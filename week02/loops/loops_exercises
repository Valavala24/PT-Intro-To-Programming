[first do these using a for loop, next try them using a while loop]


STAGE 1 QUESTIONS

1. print the numbers from 0 to 12
2. print the numbers from 1 to 12
3. print the numbers from 12 to 1
4. print the numbers from 1 to 12, where each number is multiplied by 2

STAGE 2 QUESTIONS

1. print the numbers from 1 to 12 with the word "monkey" replacing the number 4
2. print the numbers from 1 to 12 that are divisible by 3
3. print the odd numbers from 1 to 12
4. print the even numbers from 1 to 12
5. print the numbers from 1 to 12 with the word "monkey" replacing the even numbers
6. print the numbers from 1 to 12 with the word "monkey" replacing the even numbers, and multiply the odd numbers 
   by two

STAGE 3 QUESTIONS

1. print the numbers 1 to 30 where if the number is even you print "monkey", if the number is divisible by 3 you 
   do print "banana", and if the number is both even and divisible by 3 you print "monkeybanana"
2. print the sum of all of the numbers from 1 to 12
3. print the product of all of the numbers from 1 to 12



References for stage 2 questions

    a. if-else statement: an if-else statement is a statement in the form:     
        if SOMETHING IS TRUE:
            DO THIS
        elif SOMETHING ELSE IS TRUE:
            DO THIS OTHER THING
        else: 
            DO THIS THING

        an example!
        if 1+2 == 3:
            print "YEAH"
        else:
            print "NO"

        THIS WOULD PRINT "YEAH", becuase the statement 1+2 == 3 is true

    b. what does this symbol "==" even mean?: 
        There are two kinds of equal signs in python. 
        1. "=" you've seen this before. This means you are setting something equal to something else. 
                You can think about this as assigning a variable to a value. Like x = 6. Now x is 6.
        2. "==" These two equal signs next to eachother means you are asking if the two things are equal. 
                ex: >> a = "6"
                    >> b = "2 + 3" 
                    >> a == b [this can be read: a is equal to b?]
                    TRUE   
    c. what about inequality?
        Just like "==" checks if two things are equal, you can use "!=" to check if two things are not equal
                ex: >> 2 != 4  [this can be read: 2 is not equal to 4?]
                    TRUE 
    d. what does % mean?
        This symbol is called the modulo operation. The modulo operation finds the remainder after division of 
        one number by another.
        
        ex. 10 % 3 = 1 
        Often times we check if a number is even by using the modulo with the number 2.
        ex. if 10 % 2 == 0:
                10 is even
