Egads!

My sincerest apologies, but at the moment I seem to have landed myself in quite the pickle. I heard that you were taking a programming class, and so I was hoping you could help me get out of this jam…!

I have a presentation in two hours but need to somehow find and copy all the files with names ending with an underscore. So for example, I have a file “CoolPic_.img” and another file “CoolDoc_.doc” that would all need to go into my usb, along with 1000s of other such files with names that end in an underscore.

Someone told me about this thing called the “command line” that could help me somehow, but I have no idea what it is or how to use it.

Can you and a partner work together and then give me some instructions that I can try on my end?
