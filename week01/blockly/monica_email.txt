Salutations Friend!

It was great meeting you at last week’s Women Who Code meetup. I am excited about getting your help with my new job over here at Amazon, and would like to hire you for a special project for our new factory. 

Currently, we have hundreds of thousands of packages on our shelves that need to be put into shipping containers to send to our customers. It seems my division just bought lots of robots to help us, and has put me in charge of (somehow??) teaching these robots how to navigate the factory.

Where do I start? Someone on my engineering team mentioned I should look into [“Blockly Maze”](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze) to understand the basics of communicating to my robots. Can you help me understand why she said this??

Thanks so much!
