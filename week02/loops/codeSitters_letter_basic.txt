Good evening,

I hope you donâ€™t mind, but I got your name from Kenneth. He spoke wonders of your ability to efficiently complete tasks. I would like to hire you as a contractor on a project for my new company, CodeSitters Inc. 

Here at CodeSitters Inc., we babysit your children in the most efficient way possible. 

Studies have shown that counting numbers can provide a narcoleptic effect on humans under the age of 6. We would like to automate a program that counts from 1 to a random number chosen by a child in our care.

Can you help us create a program to help our sitters?

Thank you!

Candace Sinters
CodeSitters Inc.
